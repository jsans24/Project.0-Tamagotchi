# Personal Experience
As my first time building a webpage from the ground up, the tamagotchi project was a challenge to find the best starting point for a game. I decided to start with the css, because it felt like the part of the project I would struggle with the most. The app turned into an in browser console, with buttons that did multiple things. and a dynamic layout that would work on most screen sizes.
